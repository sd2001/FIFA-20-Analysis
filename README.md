# FIFA-20-Analysis
Selecting the best FIFA XI as per user given weights(4-2-3-1) formation.
The dataset that I have used is downloaded from Kaggle.The CSV File is provided in the repo.
Just Git Clone to download all the contents.
What I have done is assigned different weights to the different traits of position specific players.
Like Goalkeepers have different traits as compared to a midfielder.
Similarly a striker needs to have better finishing skills while a defender needs to have Good Defensive skills.
As per the several traits given,we have analysed each position and found what qualities does a player need to possess to be the best fit for my team.Those specific traits are assigned with different weights.
And the results we get are there in the png file.
Hope you liked it.
